      -   use / occupancy ...
      -   two visions of governance ...
   -   Conklin - Ethnographic Atlas of Ifugao (Philippines) - Anthropologist (look up for image?)
      -   again, use occupancy
      -   aerial photographs / ground truth
   -   and more .... just to understand breadth and variety (part of Antillean Visions)
      -   military style
      -   archeology
      -   3D (Rambaldi)
      -   note lack of borders ....
