========

*__Class 1__*  

1. Housekeeping
   -   Next Thursday meet in Library lit/lab - last ArcGIS Online lesson
   -   Assignment #3
      -   lightning presentations - 5 minutes total 
      -   suggested 3-5 slides @ 4 minutes max speaking time
      -   practice for final / feedback from class
      -   One day, Thursday March 30th - 2 pm - 3:15 pm (75 minutes, 12 students, 12 x 5 = 60)
      -   Talk about DATA!!!!
   -   Questions?

2. Continuing Conversation
   -   process based cartography
   -   ontologies, knowledge systems, and GIS

3. Indigenous Geography and GIS
   -   Laura Smith is now at MacAlaster College (st. Paul, Minnesota)
   -   the outside IGS technician -> common perhaps?
      -   need for training?
      -   who is mapping what for whom?
   -   p. 141 jurisdictional issues?
   -   BIA claim of "self-determination" and "empowerment"???
   -   website map is no longer available???

   -   importance of indigenous data governance
   -   data governance changing very quickly right now - perhaps a hopeful moment to intervene?

4. Agencies (only 5 so far) - put in shared doc
   -   BIA - Bureau of Indian Affairs
   -   World Wildlife Fund WWF
   -   The Indigenous Peoples of Africa Co-ordinating Committee IPACC
   -   ESRI
   -   University of Chicago
   -   Tribal GIS (.com)
   -   USGS
   -   department of transportation
   -   Ford Foundation

5. Mapping the unmappable
   -   really good bibliography (with odd exceptions - Chambers and RRA/PRA mapping in Africa - institute for development studies)
   -   marauder's map and dynamic online mapping
   -   lots of names for "Indigenous Cartography" (make a quick list - to be continued)
   -   NGOs and the UN
   -   empowerment, almost magical, mapping craze (part of larger 'geospatial turn' perhaps driven by desktop GIS?)
      -   look up ngrams?
   -   maps and cartography as "discourse" (Foucault and power)
   -   ontologies and animism
      -   relational opposed to cartesian
      -   ontological exceptionalism of humans
      -   relational ontologies and animisim widespread in hunter-gatherer societies (not cite??)
      -   realtional ontologies inherantly spatial - hopeful GIS pitch

   -   map or not to map ...

6. GIS and Relationality
   -   neutralizes cartographic erasure
   -   legitimacy
   -   cost-benefit
   -   hard question
   -   matter of responsible use
   -   case-by-case
   -   translation issues
   -   a sort of preservation/conservation of knowledge
   -   high risk/reward scenario
   -   a case for optimism
   -   GIS is used by humans (by whom, for whom, with whom?)

7. Cancel and Backhouse
   -   somewhat dated
   -   THPO - relatioonship to SHPO? Division of Historical Resources)
   -   Uses
      -   archaeology
      -   cultural resources
      -   compliance (with what?)
      -   work outside of reservation
      -   historical architecture
      -   archaeometry

8. How is GIS Used
   -   participatory mapping (?)
   -   community based mapping
   -   epidemiology
   -   Navajo land department
   -   Indian Health Service in conjunction with Navajo Nation (water quality)
   -   GIS department contract services
   -   websites (arcGIS storymaps)
   -   possibilities of connecting oral traditions to cultural artifacts
   -   defense of territory in face of development projects

   OK, but ...
   -   location
   -   treaties
   -   ownership*
   -   physical geography
   -   ethnography
   -   governance
   -   resource management*
   -   development and conservation*
   -   residential development
   -   land re-acquisition
   -   strengthen negotiating stance

9. Process?
   -   acquire data that exists
   -   engage with community
   -   maintenance and longevity
