       -   choose your tribe or indigenous group early, not your life work, just one exploration

       -   take notes on readings somewhere (data management, research skills, reference manager)
       -   reading list is a guide, and entry point; be critical  
       -   you are expected to read outside the required reading (either from suggested or things you find)

   -   content and process (Rose-Redwood)

       - define anti-colonial, de-colonial (I am not so comfortable with these terms)

       -   purpose?
       -   better or worse?
       -   ask about landgrabu ...
   -   cartographic practice (measurement, commodification) and indigenous centering (relation with earth and living communities)  
   -   problems of time, immediacy vs long-term effect  
   -   layers of meaning and purpose (Mr. Ah's map)  
   -   Weber(?) and demystification (un-magic)
