Lesson 7
======== 

*__Class 1__*  

1. Housekeeping
   -   questions, concerns
   -   Trail of Tears and photoshop ... come back to this
   -   context, context, context ....

2. Hopitutskwa
   -   As example of the second assignment ... ?
   -   One signifier, several meanings -> several maps or cartographic performances
   -   Hopitutskwa
      -   Religion is the way you walk - from African Drumming class at Berkeley - master Ghanian musician C.K. Ladzekpo
      -   translation errors in treaty's and agreements, fix retrospectively? Only stored as data in stories and songs.
      -   what is on this map (elements and features)
      -   what is missing (locator, north, graticule, roads ...)?
      -   anything else odd (eastern boundary matches Arizona - New Mexico)
      -   this delineation is derived from Hopi artist Fred Kabotie's work in 1930
         -   search for maps online --- share what you find
   - Quote 1 - speaking to how only partial knowledge is shared between clans
   - Quote 2 - speaking to the multiple definitions of "Indian Country" (Sutton)
   -   Hopi Partition with Adjudicated Areas
      -   conservation easement in 1934?
      -   consider what color could do to this map ... again, what is missing, what is included
      -   p 144 describes a set of relations that overlap in a network between clans, again, a social network graph ... like the Catawba map
      -   maps and current issues
         -   the "Cultural preservation office" - Tribal Historic Preservation Office
         -   NAGPRA - Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990
         -   national forest lands, monuments, and parks

3. Three Indian Country Maps
   -   political geography - tribes, local citizens, municipalities, counties, states, and so on
   -   Indian country as an evolving definition (perhaps indigenous territory)
      -   place like Oklahoma
      -   reservations and their surroundings (counties that contain reservations)
      -   something more relational
   -   Reservation are held in trust by federal govt (not owned by tribe) - a unique form of property - creates confusion
      -   think back to property - private common, state, open
      -   look up PL 280 - 1953 (evolving some jurisdiction to states and other local)
      -   inherent sovereignty of tribal government/nation/organization
      -   but, authority of tribe over non-indians
   -   Trust vs Fee lands - creates confusion over jurisdictions
      -   ability to sell land to non-indians (Fee simple ownership) -> happened a lot, then difficult to get back
      -   Trust land can be owned by either an organization (tribe) or a person (tribal member)
      -   different right and responsibilities between trust and fee
      -   loo up "fee trust indian"
   -   contradictions ...
      -   hunting rights in tribal/conservation areas ...
      -   settled with monetary compensation, what does that imply? relinquishment of title?
      -   sacred places ...
   -   extra-territorial (extra-legal?)
      -   Indian Country as beyond boundaries
      -   criminal jurisdiction within reservations (non-indians) and outside of reservations (indian)
      -   taxes ... zoning ... elections ... gambling ... water ... environmental regulation
      -   autonomy vs sovereignty, political vs territorial sovereignty

   -   US based analysis, how does this apply to places you are thinking about?
   -   Is the USA leading change or behind other global efforts?

4. Trail of Tears
   -   Pauls, E. Prine (2022). Trail of Tears. Encyclopedia Britannica. https://www.britannica.com/event/Trail-of-Tears
      -   Movement of Native Americans after the U.S. Indian Removal Act Map showing the movement of some 100,000 Native Americans forcibly relocated to the trans-Mississippi West under the terms of the U.S. Indian Removal Act (1830).
      -   three maps: Trail of Tears, Frontier, Trail of Tears
   -   Fixico, Donald L. (2004). History of the Western Southeast Since Removal. In R. D. Fogelson (Ed.), Handbook of North American Indians: Southeast (Vol. 14, pp. 162-173). Washington D.C.: Smithsonian Institution. p 163.
