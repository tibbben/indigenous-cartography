   -   Weber(?) and demystification (un-magic)
      -   colonialism, capitalism, modernity <=> Disenchantment
      -   1918, actually borrowed from someone else
   -   Geography: human > nature, nature > human, divine design

   -   *Exercise* what kinds of map themes can you think of?
      -   navigation 
      -   resource management  
      -   property(?)  - literal descriptions
      -   language and toponyms 
      -   mental maps - "all cultures engage in some form of mapmaking" Pearce
      -   re-presented ...
      -   story telling devices

4. *Exercise*: when thinking of ancestral maps, what subdivisions can you think of?
   -   go through all examples and then do exercise
5. Performance ... from Pearce and Louis
   -   a vision of ancestral by describing what is not ancestral - sometimes a good way to describe things that are hard to put in words.
   -   names and meaning

      -   translations (words and spatialities)
      -   names (and translations) change with context
   -   dreams 
   -   separation of performer from audience ... gods view vs being in the map
   -   is the *goal* possible (Pearce p 123 bottom)
