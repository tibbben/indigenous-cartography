*__Class 1__*  

1. Introductions and Housekeeping  
   -   Citations - APA - but really about ability to find and consistency ... BUT, practice!! Maps are different ...
   -   Remind students about photoshop/illustrator/arcgis pro - should have received invitation - questions?
   -   additional materials in syllabus - books and online resources
   -   notes?? shared doc somewhere where everyone can edit? perhaps etherpad??
2. What is a map
   -   Weber(?) and demystification (un-magic)
      -   colonialism, capitalism, modernity <=> Disenchantment
      -   1918, actually borrowed from someone else
   -   Geography: human > nature, nature > human, divine design
      - traces on a Rhodean Shore - Glacken
   -   *Exercise* what kinds of map themes can you think of?
      -   navigation 
      -   resource management  
      -   property(?)  - literal descriptions
      -   language and toponyms 
      -   mental maps - "all cultures engage in some form of mapmaking" Pearce
      -   re-presented ...
      -   story telling devices
   -   places (borders) for governance, not exclusion
      -   delineations as buffered areas
      -   The regional map from HOC
3. Typologies 
   -   Rose-Redwood (three)
   -   Note in Lucchesi (four)
   -   map (p. 80) from Herman (typology) 
   -   hybrid
   -   process and product ...
4. *Exercise*: when thinking of ancestral maps, what subdivisions can you think of?
   -   go through all examples and then do exercise
5. Performance ... from Pearce and Louis
   -   a vision of ancestral by describing what is not ancestral - sometimes a good way to describe things that are hard to put in words.
   -   names and meaning
      -   heavenscape - from original language how translated, how distorted. p 113
      -   translations (words and spatialities)
      -   names (and translations) change with context
   -   dreams 
   -   separation of performer from audience ... gods view vs being in the map
   -   is the *goal* possible (Pearce p 123 bottom) 
       -   restorative justice (Lucchesi)
       -   more map training for indigenous peoples
   -   geobrujas??
   -   glorification of indigenous knowledge  
   -   lack of discussion around violence, punishment, conflict  
6. Other references??

*__Class 2__*  

1. Introduction and Housekeeping

2. Expectations for ArcGIS Online use in class
   - as a taste of future work options (not a GIS class)
   - story maps (second tutorial at some point)
   - ArcGIS Online vs ArcGIS Pro, ArcMap Desktop, and QGIS
   - either as potential work (directly) or management - think key concepts and terms
   - engagement with geospatial data sources and how to use

3. Review of Lecture
   - stories vs analysis - link to the hockey stick graph
   - GIS as data management
   - too easy to make a bad map, much harder to make a good story

4. ArcGIS Online Introduction - group work - 60 min 2:25
   - go through login in, getting ArcGIS Pro if they want, issues (is there anyone who cannot login) 5 min
   - have them perform tutorial all the way through creating and sharing the group map - 45 min
   - discuss division of labor within groups
   - trace some trees - 10 min

Tribal Lands Ceded
Tribal Lands (Census AIANNH) 


Notes:  

-   Use Waldseemüller’s 1507 map - naming of America instead of Turtle Island
