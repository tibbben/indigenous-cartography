Lesson 9
========

*__Class 1__*  

1. Housekeeping
   -   midterm general advice / feedback
      -   Try to take out personal references
      -   Try to give a little cultural context as well as historical context (mostly really good)
      -   Check APA: (LName, date) > Lname, FI (date). Title ...
      -   citing a map is like inline citation, not full source  
   -   Thursday meet in Library lit/lab
   -   Assignment #3
      -   lightning presentations - 5 minutes total 
      -   suggested 3-5 slides @ 4 minutes max speaking time
      -   practice for final / feedback from class
      -   One day, Thursday March 30th - 2 pm - 3:15 pm (75 minutes, 12 students, 12 x 5 = 60)
   -   Questions?

2. Definitions of GIS
   -   people, purpose, military history
   -   ecosystem?
   -   modified GIS

3. Data Models
   -   have existed way before computing
   -   an attempt to create a universal abstraction
   -   tables, trees, triples (is there more?)
   -   mostly tables for GIS - relational database
      -   join ~ relate
      -   locations linked to attributes
      -   models of phenomena on the earth ~ story
   -   data types are important (numbers, text, other ...)
   -   enable basic things: selection, modification, saving => storytelling with purpose

4. Take a moment to think about Indigenous world view / knowledge systems / knowledge keeping / knowledge transmission / knowledge preservation
    -   is there one universal indigenous knowledge system / are there many local indigenous knowledge systems
       -   what do they share? or what do they not share?
    -   is it possible to create a data model for this? Has it already been done?  
    -   important concepts
       -   ontologies (what is considered to 'exist' and how they are categorized)
       -   keywords and words

5. Earth Vision
   -   sets up questions: both the idea of the 'cartavist' - academic activism and that of indigenous self-determination through maps and GIS
      -   introduction to next few weeks ... we will explore this more
      -   is this countered by events such as Sand Creek Masacre (throw down weapons as martyrs)?
   -   Kerski - last 17 years at ESRI as an "Education Manager" with a focus in Indigenous outreach
   -   GIS fits well with native views ... (?!)
   -   GIS one of fastest growing tech fields (2004) - true still?
   -   How do native tribes use GIS?? Have them think of examples ...

6. Cartographic process (and GIS process) (Rundstrom)
   -   article written as computerized GIS is taking off ...
      -   North American (geography) bias
      -   author/audience positionality
   -   maps (military) emphasize text (map) over process, perhaps counter to most indigenous knowledge systems
   -   is a process focus typically indigenous? See page 10 notes on how product sold out immediately ...
   -   maps are
      -   snapshots in time, but not seen as such
      -   always exclusionary
   -   possibility to "engage with enfranchised culture on own terms"
   -   google "Inuit Place Name Map Series of Nunavik"

7. SpatioTemporal Models for TEK
   -   GIS and 4D grids
   -   GIS and legibility (Scott - seeing like a state)
   -   knowledge check - 'cadaster' - 'cadastral'
   -   the 6 suggestions
      -   proper -> property: cause disputes or resolve them?
      -   spray paint boundaries? -> legal tensions
      -   are these useful for other kinds of mapping?
      -   limits in data models and advances in technology
         -   web based mapping ~2005
         -   videos/time sliders for maps (2015)
         -   storymaps (ESRI 2013)
   -   does GIS fit well with indigenous knowledge systems? The idea of the Motif.
      -   a special model/ontology that allows different queries
      -   nodelike (points), pathlike (lines), regionlike (polygons)
