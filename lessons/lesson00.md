Indigenous Cartography and Cartography of the Indigenous

Title Slide
- Introduction, self, thanks to all, library, institute for data science and computing, NAGIS, many people I have shared time and space working on maps with through the years, including students, 
- Land acknowledgment extends to entire planet
  - recent news in Brazil - Bill 490 has passed lower house of congress which may block all new recognition of indigenous lands if signed into law (existing reservations remain, but no new ones can be created) - from Reuters: "Indigenous leaders want President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who defeated Bolsonaro in last year's election, to protect some 300 territories that were mapped out years ago but have not been formally recognized."
  - not to diminish importance of local South Florida tribes, but make this a global conversation
  - map image is of a place located in present day state of Hidalgo Mexico, north of Mexico City
  - likely authors indigenous identity as Nahuatl speaking Aztecs, whose descendants continue to speak Nahuatl today
  - with global acknowledgement, talk will focus on the western hemisphere
- The hybrid of the image
  - the indigenous encounter with western cartography, I cannot speak to true Indigenous cartography
  - map made with "consultation" of local community by Nahuatl elites for Spanish elites
  - in some ways similar to my positionality as a extraordinarily privileged white male academic with European (thus linked to colonial) ancestry
    - In much of my experience I am the external actor soliciting local information to draw maps
      - a form of "participatory" data gathering
    - I cannot speak for any indigenous group
      - instead only share my experience from my vantage point
      - my experience is one-sided and flawed
      - this is also, as was the class, a sort of fast and somewhat superficial tour of the question, an overview
      - and given that all maps are political statements full of controversy
      - I will likely offend some people, please let me know and let's talk if you have time
  - themes present in the image: blended traditions, hybrid worldview, Mundy's "double conciousness", contracted elite artists, is it indigenous cartography or cartography of the indigenous?

Map or be mapped ...
- Nietchmanns's quote
  - full disclosure, Nietschmann introduced me to this world through participatory mapping and the Maya Atlas
  - Some of his assertions are know to be false ... [easy, inexpensive, no need for permits, maps & guns]
    - maps are easier than 50-60 years ago, but still not easy to produce legitimate map
    - again, legitimate maps cost money ...
    - several years after this assertion, it was necessary to lie at military checkpoints to get maps into Malaysian Borneo in the state of Sarawak (logging vs indigenous interests)
    - Dennis Wood, maps backed by guns are much more powerful than a a map alone
- leads us to the question often posed by Nietschmann, "to map or be mapped?"
- this will be the frame of the talk today
  - guided by a recent experience teaching an upper division/graduate course at UM
    - in which I also offended some people, still learning ...

Example of maps as tools to seize land (1776)
- not just a remarkable claim, but that 
- Dennis Wood reminds us that maps *and* guns are more powerful than just maps

Defining Maps - Indigenous
- Indigenous Cartography: Rose-Redwood, et al., Lucchesi
  - admittedly oversimplified, but a good starting point
  - perhaps add in some kind of cooperative vs extractive element, participation (from Tolcayacu image)
  - art??
- non-graphic maps, oral traditions, icaros, peyote healing songs, dances
  - navigation in both physical and spiritual worlds - dream mapping ...
  - repositories of knowledge that remain important and perhaps deserve more attention, but not in scope of this talk
    - Francisco Montes Shuna - Peruvian vegetalista (ayahuasquero)
    - Verdell Primeaux (vocals), Johnny Mike (vocals), Robert Attson (vocals) (Healing & Peyote Songs: In Sioux and Navajo)
- I am not an expert on this subject and will not attempt to speak to these
  - but perhaps more important than the maps I will speak of ... 
  - as Indigenous thinker/scholar Lyla June Johnston suggests, the inter-generational trauma that Europeans carried to turtle island as explorers and colonists is largely the cause of the genocide that ensued, healing this trauma is perhaps our greatest priority in the long term. Letting it continue only causes more trauma. Maps are indeed secondary from this perspective ... in any case ...

Defining Maps - Cartography of the Indigenous:
-  The Harley and Woodward definition
  - to some degree how "most" people think of maps - emphasize *graphic representations*
  - much material on indigenous cartography in this well-known set of volumes (show index page)
  - due to my experience and perspective, this I can speak to more

Mercator Example 1569
- changed navigation with bearing lines from place to place
- celebrated as a great human achievement, still used today
- but also had enormous negative impact on native peoples everywhere
- also in how native Americans were portrayed

John Smith Example 1624
- acknowledges the native settlements - unlike the Pownall 1776 map
- the Sasquesahanougs are a Gyant people & thus atyred (Susquehannocks - but really not the right name)
- likely imaginative ...

Diego Palomino example (1549) included in Relaciones Geograficas of Chuquimayo (King Phillip II 1579–1585)
- knowledge of the kingdom .... first step of imposing legibility (James Scott - Seeing Like a State)
- clear distinction between native and non-native settlements

Why we make maps (in the context of colonialism and capitalism ..)
- maps as stories, as much today as historically
- in this sense, stories about property rights
- maps *always* have *political* purpose
- often about boundaries and measurement ...

Property is Theft
- while an extreme view, perhaps time to reconsider?

An outline of talk
- kind of a light buffet of:
  - historical (I am not an expert, but the context is important)
  - more contemporary in terms of conflict over resources and land
- always with presence of mind
  - the slippery nature of Indigenous and context

Some Ancestral Examples ... entirely from the history of cartography

Map Rock - Idaho
- The block of basalt is at the base of a 150-meter-high cliff 600 meters northeast of Givens Hot Springs, Canyon County, Idaho, on the north side of the Snake River. 
- The "map" face is oriented toward the river and slightly upstream, so that it confronts anyone traveling down the valley.

Marshallese Stick Chart - Rebbelib
- on display at the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive. 
- It is made of wood, sennit fiber and cowrie shells.
- "As with the other types of charts, the rebbelib were not consulted during voyages." observed by Captain Winkler ~1901?

Pawnee Start Chart - date unknown
- importance of celestial bodies (and maps) to many Indigenous Peoples
- Originally belonging to the Skiri band of Pawnees, the chart was collected at Pawnee, Oklahoma, in 1906 as part of a sacred bundle. It may be a descendant of a precontact original. 
- The Milky Way, which the Pawnees thought of as parting the heavens and as the pathway of departed spirits, is represented by small dots across the middle of the chart. 
- Adjacent to the Milky Way is a circle of eleven stars known as the Council of Chiefs. 
- The North Star ("star-that-does-notmove"), chief over the other stars, is among the largest. There are traces of three pigments: black, red, and yellow.

Peter Skipper Jila Japirnka, 1987. "Water Holes at Jila Japingka and Pajpara with Parallel San Hills" 
- Aboriginal artist, Peter Skipper was born around 1929
- Pijaju Peter Skipper (c.1929-2007)
- Commissioned by Duncan Kentish

- important to note that none of these examples locate or indicate property
- although there are some resource locations indicated and navigational instructions ...

Relaciones Geograficas (King Phillip II 1579–1585) - ordering of territory

Misantla 1579 - as a direct response to the relaciones geograficas
- Pérez de Arteaga, Diego (artist), Delgado, Gaspar (contributor), Pérez de Arteaga, Diego (signer), Pérez de Arteaga, Diego (scribe)

Cempoala Map 1580 - all following Mundy
- extra-ordinary blend of Indigenous Iconography and the demands of the Relaciones Geograficas
- place of twenty - head of a Totonac Noble (Indigenous People) (all Mundy 1996 - the mapping of new spain)
- Hill is made of skin of earth monster Tlaltecuhtli
- blend of symbolic and written toponyms
- so many contributors to one map
- some initial boundary lines ...

- similarities
  - blended authorship for the relaciones, commissioned maps
  - similar iconography for churches ... a Spanish icon
  - participatory? how so? data gathering? consultations? painting? extractive?
  - "double conciousness"
  - shifting perspectives (not a static reader from one position, but moving around to understand)
- not much else

Beginning of anti-colonial

Codex (all following Annita Luchessi 2018 - Indians Don't make maps)
- genealogy and property of the de Leon family, who are descendants of Quetzalecatzin, a major Nahua leader in the late 1400s
- Documenting the transition from Indigenous nationhood to colonial occupation and the development of colonial society, the Codex Quetzalecatzin has been lauded as one of the most important documents in Indigenous history.
- natural dyes, connections to land and tradition, but at the same time assimilation, resilience, survivorship
- an adaptation to the encounter ....

Huaman Poma map - Guaman Poma, Phelipe (~1615) - Nueva coronica y buen gobierno
- Phelipe Guaman Poma
- Sent to king Philip III of Spain as historical account and call to attention the problems of the conquest
- rediscovered in 1908 ...
- perhaps first ever "counter map" - peluso 1995 - "if maps can be seen as one of many "authoritative resources" that the state mobilizes to consolidate power ..., then local groups' appropriation of the technology of mapping may help to counterbalance or at least to offset the previous monopoly of authoritative resources by the state or capital" (p 386). 
 - the "double conciousness" of Mundy
   - lineages of the Incas as part of map 
   - sea monsters to fill open space

Colonial - Participatory - Extractive??

San Juan de Tolcayuca (redux) late 17th
- it is a property map, the parcel of interest is the two hills, but there are no boundaries ...
- the footprints are the route of the surveyor/map maker
- locating the main church with relations to other surrounding churches (towns)
- negotiation, consultation, Hidalgo and Trail of Footprints 
- large tradition of meso american property maps
- perhaps exemplary of both cartography of indigenous and indigenous cartography

Participatory data gathering / informants / extractive

Lewis and Clark (1804-06)
- Many saw United States’ economic expansion as the realization of Jefferson’s goals for the Lewis and Clark Expedition. To indigenous Americans, however, the Lewis and Clark Expedition symbolizes a devastating U.S. citizen invasion that challenged their ways of life. | National Park Service
- the map show the great exploration ... the story is of invasion and claiming of names
- in some ways similar to the Mercator map, it opened the doors to colonization
- details on the numbers of Indigenous Souls - data
- cartography of the Indigenous perhaps exemplary
- went right through Yellowstone, Yep-pe, Po-hah, Ne-moy... Shoshone

Immutable mobiles - Latour 1987
- story from 1787, Lapérouse, captain of L'Astrolabe exploring eastern Pacific, encounters local informants that help him fill in empty spaces on a map. This information gets copied to a more permenant document and then it is returned to Versailles ... more trips followed, more information flowed to the heart of the French Empire.
- The maps are labelled as immutable mobiles in cycles of accumulation
- "In less than three centuries of travels such as this one, the nascent science of geography has gathered more knowledge about the shape of the world than had come in millenia. The implicit geography of the natives is made explicit by geographers; the local knowledge of the savages becomes the universal knowledge of the cartographers; the fuzzy, approximate and ungrounded beliefs of the locals are turned into a precise, certain and justified knowledge. To the partisans of the Great Divide, it seems that going from ethnogeography to geography is like going from childhood to adulthood, from passion to reason, from savagery to civilisation, or from first degree intuitions to second degree reflexion." p 216
- THE reason for counter mapping: "At every run of this accumulation cycle [from core to periphery to core], more elements are gathered in the. centre (represented by a circle at the top); at every run the , asymmetry (at the bottom) between the foreigners and the natives grows, ending ( today in something that indeed looks like a Great Divide, or at least like a disproportionate relation between those equipped with satellites who localise the 'locals' on their computer maps without even leaving their air-conditioned room in Houston, and the helpless natives who do not even see the satellites passing over their heads." p 221

#Kohlux Map 1869
#- showing real signs of government involvement in mapping the Indigenous in North America
#- participation as data providers

Venn Diagram from Cole Sutton
- a more contemporary vision of the encounter
- remove the GIS and tribal USA references, and this diagram serves well to think about both historical and contemporary encounters at a global scale
- more general examples in the Work of Vine Deloria Jr and his criticism and praise of academic / Indigenous encounters (mostly anthropologists) in the United States
- also similar to the agrarian reform in Peru, constitutional restructuring of property rights - Cuentos Feos de la Reforma Agraria Peruana - Enrique Mayer

Brody - Maps and Dreams 1981 - North Eastern British Colombia
- Treaty 8 area (1899) - Inuit
- Land Use and Occupancy Project (published in Freeman 1976, and Brody continued the work)
  -  "In February 1973 Inuit Tapirisat of Canada proposed to the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs that research be undertaken to produce a comprehensive and verifiable record of Inuit land use and occupancy in the Northwest Territories of Canada. The record so obtained would delimit the present and past use and occupation of the land and marine environment and would categorize the uses which any particular area served. In view of the continuing role which land plays in defining the cultural and ecologic circumstances of Inuit society, the research was also to provide an explicit statement - by the Inuit - of their perception of the man-land relationship." preface p. 19 Freeman M.M.R. (1976) - Inuit land use and occupancy project Report, 
- government funded and executed by consulting agency Milton Freeman Research Limited
- hundreds of interviews (mostly about hunting?) and over 200 maps ... 
- First time the overlay that clearly shows different visions of land use and development ....

Intro to Participatory Mapping
- part of the cannon, but really there may be a need to extend this deeper historically
- all white guys - white savior syndrome or something else? - map or be mapped ... but white men hold the expertise (at that time, I would argue that this is shifting ...)
- since then has exploded
- Indigenous Cartography or Cartography of the Indigenous ...?
- Robert Chambers very active in Development in Africa
  - Institute of Development Studies (IDS)w
  - Rapid Rural Appraisal, Participatory Rural Appraisal
  - this work led to mapping

Conklin 1980 - Ethnographic atlas of Ifugao : a study of environment, culture, and society in Northern Luzon (phillipines)
- ~ 100,000 people (tribe), practice terraced agriculture
- beginnings of boundaries, groundbreaking in cartographic analysis - aerial photographs / ground truth
- again, use occupancy, but really an anthropology study of practices and use
- agricultural use and forest use, not hunting

Bill Bunge
- perhaps the first to give voice to inner city blacks through maps 
- but a pioneer in urban participatory mapping
- see also - Jane Addams and the Hull House mapping - first woman to win Nobel Peace Prize - not for blacks but for poor immigrants in Chicago in late 19th century

PM Boom
- ok, this looks promising, BUT 
- tyranny of participation (Uma Kothari and Bill Cooke)
- levels of participation (Sherry Arnstein, Elizabeth Rocha) 
- extractive vs cooperative vs empowering (peter Kyem, Jon Corbett)
- gender imbalances (Diana Rocheleau)
- who owns the maps (Robert Chambers)
- ILO 169 (1989) - Rio Earth Summit - Articles 13-19 (ownership, management and conservation of natural resources, removal not allowed, free [prior] and informed consent)

Maya Atlas - Southern Belize 1997
- motivated by invasive logging interests from Malaysia
- external experts invited in to do participatory mapping
- world bank oil pipeline project halted
- ongoing struggle to get land titles to this day
- note the attempt to 'translate' Maya knowledge into 'Legitimate' maps
- no boundaries of actual towns, but of land use - used as a collective claim
- resulted in Maya representation in national government at table where logging concessions negotiated
- did not stop concessions being granted
- Atlas in all local schools

Miskito through to PM (fast)

Peru
- last slide reminds me of Gramscii's concept of the role of intellectuals in mediating state-society relationships

Conclusions
- reminded of Audry Lorde's "The Masters Tools Will NEver Bring Down the Masters House"
  - but is the goal to destroy or adapt? completely change or defend rights?
