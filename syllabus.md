### Evaluation of Student Performance:  
Students will be assigned a letter grade (A-F) based on the following:

| Evaluated work | percentage / points |  
|:--- |:--- |  
| Class Participation | 10% / 25 pts |  
| Homework Assignments #1, #2, and #3 | 20% / 50 pts |  
| Midterm | 20% / 50 pts |  
| Final Project | 30% / 75 pts |  
| Final | 20% / 50 pts |
| Total | 100% / 250 pts |  

### Class Participation  
Engagement in class activities such as discussions of assigned reading and class material and/or presentations of assignments is an important aspect of the learning in this course. This will include speaking in front of the class and holding respectful conversations with the instructor and other class members during meeting times.

### Assignments  
There will be reading assignments for each class as per the schedule below; reading assignments are to be completed before class meetings and students should be prepared to engage in discussions of the material assigned. Note that suggested reading is provided both as a means for students to improve their understanding of class material and as potential resources for the assignments. Throughout the course there will be four major assignments that build into a final class project (the fourth assignment). Each of the assignments will be related to one tribe or Indigenous group that the student identifies in the first assignment and build into the final class project. All bibliographies will be in the APA 7th Edition format. Late assignments will not be accepted; make-ups are only considered in the case of a documented medical emergency.

### Prompt for Assignment #1 (due week 3) : Due Friday February 3rd by 11:59 pm  
Identify a Tribe or Indigenous group that you are interested in. In a short justification for your choice (of no less than 500 words and no more than 1000 words) give a brief introduction to the tribe or Indigenous group that includes notes on their historical and contemporary experience of their geography, beliefs or ways of knowing, lifestyle or livelihood, political practices, and anything else considered important. Include a reflection on your positionality as a student writing about the tribe or Indigenous group. What interests you about this particular group? Do you have previous knowledge? Do you have connections? What is the purpose of your choice? Is there some particular aspect that you would like to learn more about? Are there any primary or secondary sources you are interested in? All sources of information should be identified in a bibliography (not included in the word count).

### Prompt for Assignment #2 (due week 7)
With the Tribe or Indigenous group identified in Assignment #1 research their history from the perspective of maps and map making. Almost every indigenous group will have either been mapped by others, may have directly participated in cartographic enterprises, or may be actively engaged with creating and using maps for governance or other purposes. References from the syllabus for this course can be used as secondary sources; at least two references not on the syllabus to either primary or secondary sources must be cited. Present your research in a written paper between a minimum of 1000 and a maximum of 1500 words, references not included. 

### Prompt for Assignment #3 (due week 10)
Using the materials from assignments #1 and #2 create a ten-minute (maximum) presentation about the identified tribe or Indigenous group. The presentation format will be in Microsoft PowerPoint, Apple KeyNote, or a similar slide-based presentation platform. The presentation will draw from the material in Assignment #1 and in addition will use at least three references from any of the assigned readings in the syllabus (for projects focused on contemporary Indigenous cartography reading ahead will be allowed with instructor approval).

### Prompt for Assignment #4: Final Class Project (due week 14)
With the Tribe or Indigenous group identified in earlier assignments tell a story about them with one or more maps. Students will use online platforms such as the ESRI ArcGIS StoryMap platform or KnightLabs Storymap.js or can choose to present one or more printed maps in the context of a short essay. The presentation will include elements drawn from prior assignments Each student project must be vetted with the instructor in order to be considered as the final graded project.

Example project ideas:  

- Research the cartographic history of a (North American) Tribe / Indigenous Group and present story map  
- Research natural resource conflict between Indigenous Group / Tribe and role of maps in the conflict  
- Research cartographic technique for making maps inclusive of indigenous ways of knowing  

### Midterm and Final Exam

Both the midterm and the final exam will include short answer and essay sections. The midterm will be based on reading and other assignments up until week 7 and the final will be based on reading and other assignments from week 8 to week 14 (not comprehensive).
