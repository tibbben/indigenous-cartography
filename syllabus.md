
**Methods of Instruction:**  
Lecture-discussion, demonstration, and practical out-of-class and
in-class assignments. Students are expected to participate in the
lectures, discussions, and in-class projects. We expect that students
have little or no prior GIS/cartography experience/training.

**Evaluation of Student Performance:**  
Students will be assigned a letter grade (A-F) based on the following:

| Evaluated work | percentage / points |  
|:--- |:--- |  
| Homework Assignments | 20% / 50 pts |  
| Class Participation | 10% / 25 pts |  
| Midterm Project | 30% / 75 pts |  
| Final Project | 40% / 100 pts |  
| Total | 100% / 250 pts |  

**Assignments**  
There will be several homework assignments throughout the semester. This
will include reading and writing assignments, online tutorial
assignments, and cartography/GIS assignments.

**Class Participation**  
Engagement in class activities through speaking, contributing comments
to the class web-page, or participating in group projects is an
important aspect of this class

**Midterm Project**  
Choose one Tribe or Indigenous group and research their history from the perspective of maps and map making. Almost every indigenous group will have either been mapped by others, may have directly participated in cartographic enterprises, or may be actively engaged with creating and using maps for governance or other purposes. Present your research in a written paper between 1000 and 1500 words. You will also be expected to give a short presentation (5 minutes maximum) in class that showcases your research and the Tribes story.

**Final Project**  
TBD

*project ideas__:*
- research the cartographic history of a (North American) Tribe / Indigenous Group and present story map
- research natural resource conflict between Indigenous Group / Tribe and role of maps in the conflict
- research cartographic technique for making maps with indigenous ways of knowing addressed


**Weekly Schedule:**  
All topics/dates/assignments are subject to revision/change based on
instructor decisions and any other *force majeur* that may take place
during the quarter.
