### Methods of Instruction:  
Lecture-discussion, demonstration, and practical out-of-class and in-class assignments. Students are expected to participate in the lectures, discussions, and in-class projects. There is no pre-requisite for knowledge of geographic information systems (GIS) or cartography, but students are expected to perform self-directed research based on primary and secondary sources of information.

### Evaluation of Student Performance:  
Students will be assigned a letter grade (A-F) based on the following:

| Evaluated work | percentage / points |  
|:--- |:--- |  
| Homework Assignments | 20% / 50 pts |  
| Class Participation | 10% / 25 pts |  
| Midterm Project | 30% / 75 pts |  
| Final Project | 40% / 100 pts |  
| Total | 100% / 250 pts |  

### Assignments  
There will be several homework assignments throughout the semester. This will include reading and writing assignments, online tutorial assignments, and cartography/GIS assignments. Late assignments will not be accepted; make-ups are only considered in the case of a documented medical emergency.

### Class Participation  
Engagement in class activities through speaking, contributing comments to the class web-page, or participating in group projects is an important aspect of this class.

### Midterm Project  
Choose one Tribe or Indigenous group and research their history from the perspective of maps and map making. Almost every indigenous group will have either been mapped by others, may have directly participated in cartographic enterprises, or may be actively engaged with creating and using maps for governance or other purposes. Present your research in a written paper between 1000 and 1500 words. You will also be expected to give a short presentation (5 minutes maximum) in class that showcases your research and the Tribes story.

### Final Project  
Choose one Tribe or Indigenous group and tell a story about them with one or more maps.  Each student project must be vetted with the instructor in order to be considered as the final graded project.

project ideas:  

- research the cartographic history of a (North American) Tribe / Indigenous Group and present story map  
- research natural resource conflict between Indigenous Group / Tribe and role of maps in the conflict  
- research cartographic technique for making maps inclusive of indigenous ways of knowing  

### Weekly Schedule:

during the quarter.
