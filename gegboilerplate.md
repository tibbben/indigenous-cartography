### Plagiarism and Misconduct - the UM Honor Code:  

The Universityâ€™s policy on academic misconduct is contained in the University of Miami Honor Code.  

These Codes are established for the student body to protect the academic integrity of the University of Miami, to encourage consistent ethical behavior among students, and to foster a climate of fair competition. While a student's commitment to honesty and personal integrity is assumed and expected, these Codes are intended to provide an added measure of assurance that, in fulfilling the University's requirements, the student will never engage in falsification, plagiarism, or other deception regarding the materials he/she presents. Each student is responsible for completing the academic requirements of each course in the manner indicated by the faculty. Please see the appropriate link below.

###English Language and Writing Support:  

Whether you need help with English language and writing support, students can  be assisted through the Writing Center.  

The Writing Center at the University of Miami offers free, one-on-one assistance with all types of writing concerns.  Located at the University of Miami Learning Commons in Richter Library, the Writing Center can help you at any stage of the writing process, from brainstorming to final revisions.  The Writing Center serves all of the University of Miami community, including students, faculty, and staff.  

The Writing Center is a teaching environment. We will work to teach you ways to improve your writing, but we will not proofread or edit your papers for you. (We will, however, teach you how to proofread and edit your own papers.) Our focus is more on helping you improve as a writer, rather than fixing the paper you bring in.  

For help with your writing projects, schedule a consultation or walk in today.  Appointments last either 25 or 50 minutes.  To get the most from your Writing Center session, please bring the assignment prompt with you, and the paper printed out. You may also want to bring other related materials (previously graded papers, drafts, research, etc.).  

To make an appointment call (305) 284-2956 or [reserve online](http://miami.mywconline.com/){:target="\_blank"} .
