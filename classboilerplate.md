### Class Attendance and Absences  

Regular and punctual class attendance is mandatory; three unexcused absences constitutes grounds for dismissal from the course and/or a failing grade. Excused absences require written notification and are granted by the instructor.  

It is each student’s responsibility to know and understand the instructor’s policies. It is also the student’s responsibility to give the instructor notice one week prior to any anticipated absence and to contact the instructor within one week after any unanticipated absence.  

All students are responsible for material covered during their absence. However, the instructor must allow each student who is absent for a University approved reason either the opportunity to make up, or to be excused from, work missed, without any reduction in the student’s final course grade as a direct result of such absence.  

Other than absences for a University-approved reason, the instructor determines whether or not an absence is for an acceptable reason and whether or not students shall have the opportunity to make up missed work. If the instructor does not recognize the reason as acceptable, the student may appeal to the chair of the department.  

*UNIVERSITY-APPROVED REASONS FOR ABSENCES*  

1. Participation in an activity approved by the Academic Deans Policy Council, such as musical and debate activity, R.O.T.C. function, or varsity athletic trip; participation in a special academic activity such as a field trip or other special event connected with academic coursework. Verification of a student’s participation shall be issued by the sponsor when authorized by the Office of the Executive Vice President and Provost.  
2. Observance of a religious holy day as described in the Religious Holy Day Policy, below:

*RELIGIOUS HOLY DAY POLICY*  

The University of Miami, although a secular institution, is determined to accommodate those students who wish to observe religious holy days. It seeks to reflect its awareness of and sensitivity to religious holy days whenever possible when scheduling University activities. The following provisions are meant to apply equitably to all religious groups and to provide opportunities to all to meet their religious obligations.  

1. Except as specifically provided to the contrary, this policy is binding on all students in undergraduate programs. Schools offering graduate or professional programs, including undergraduate professional programs, are strongly encouraged to adhere to these policies to the maximum extent practicable.  
2. Any student absent from class in observance of a religious holy day shall not be penalized in any way for an examination or assignment missed during the period of absence. Absence in observance of a religious holy day does not relieve students from responsibility for any part of the course work required during the period of absence. Students who are absent on days of examinations or class assignments shall be offered a reasonable opportunity to make up the work without penalty, if the student previously arranged to be absent. Nothing in this policy shall preclude faculty members from limiting the number of student absences to a reasonable number of absences for any reason. The faculty member has discretion to determine how the make-up obligation will be fulfilled. A faculty member who penalizes a student contrary to these provisions may have committed unprofessional conduct, and thus may be subject to a complaint to the Committee on Professional Conduct under the provisions of Section B4.9 of the Faculty Manual.  
3. It is the student’s obligation to provide faculty members with notice of the dates they will be absent due to observance of religious holy days, preferably before the beginning of classes but no later than the end of the first three class days. For religious holy days that fall within the first three class days, students must provide faculty members with notice no later than two class days before the absence. Missing a class due to travel plans associated with a particular religious holy day does not constitute an excused absence. Absences due to observance of religious holy days that are not pre-arranged with the relevant faculty member within the first three class days may be considered unexcused, and the faculty member may therefore prevent the student from making up examinations or assignments missed during the period of absence.  
4. Faculty members are encouraged to anticipate days when a substantial number of students will be absent for observance of religious holy days and should avoid scheduling examinations and assignment deadlines on those days. Faculty members are expected to reasonably assist students in obtaining class information the student missed during the period of absence in observance of a religious holy day. In that regard, faculty members are urged to allow taping or recording of the class session, with the reproduction limited to the student’s personal use, when a student misses a class due to observance of a religious holy day. To assist in identifying religious observance days, faculty members are encouraged to consult the illustrative list provided in the Interfaith Calendar [http://www.interfaithcalendar.org](http://www.interfaithcalendar.org){:target="\_blank"}. Faculty members are urged to remind students of their obligation to inform faculty members within the first three class days of any anticipated absences due to observance of religious holy days and should include that information in the syllabus or course requirements document for that course.
